 Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to build and train classification models using the famous Iris dataset.

Overview
The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of iris flowers, along with their corresponding species label. The goal of this project is to predict the species of iris flowers based on these features.

Dataset
The Iris dataset used in this project is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). It consists of 150 samples, with each species having 50 samples. The dataset is commonly used for machine learning classification tasks and is well-suited for beginners.

Project Structure
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `iris.csv`: CSV file containing the Iris dataset.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Anjaliyadav15/Irisi_flower-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Irisi_flower-Classification
   ```

3. Open and run the `iris_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter environment to explore the dataset, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

 Results
The notebook contains detailed analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset, along with the implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The models' performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

 Conclusion
Through this project, we have successfully demonstrated the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for iris flower classification. Further improvements and experimentation can be done to enhance the model's performance and explore advanced techniques.
